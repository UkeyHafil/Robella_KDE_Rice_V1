please be wary that i'm not github master, coding is not my priority yet. so i'm apologize for this mess

i have updated this github wih updated stuff and this is officially one of my fully customize theme. since this is V1. dont expect too much with hyprland, rofi ect.

and for starter, check "show hidden files" on the file manager settings

Where to put the files: 

- .bashrc > /home/
- sm > /home/.conky/simple media 
- config.jsonc > /home/.config/fastfetch 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the Styles, i'm only change the window decoration search "Fluent-round" on KDE Store. later on when i got free time, i'm might fully customize the KDE Themes with my own color accent

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
and here is conky configuration:

1. Install conky and Conky manager on your system and close the app
2. Go to conky directory (/home/.conky) to create the new folder. name it "simple media"
3. After downloading the file, put it inside the folder that you created
4. Open conky manager to enable the media by check the file
5. If there some misfit because the resolution difference,open the sm file and change the gap_x and gap_y value to fit desktop screen. since mine is using 1080p screen with 100% scale
6. Open the app back and enjoy
